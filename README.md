## Description
To update and get information from a MySQL Database is often not straightforward. 

This app uses "Inquirer" to prompt the user and guide them step by step in fetching and inputting data to an employee database, so the user can keep track of Employees in an organization as it continues to evolve.

"console.table" allows the user to see the database info right on the console log so the user doesn't have to switch screens.

And SQL JOINs under the hood mean that you don't have to go digging through different tables to tell what's going on in your company!
